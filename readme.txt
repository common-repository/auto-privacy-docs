Quickly generates pages or html for Privacy Policy, Terms of Use, Cookies Policy, EULA, and Disclaimers

== Description ==
Auto Privacy Docs allows you to easily generate pages or html for Privacy Policy, Terms of Use, Cookies Policy, EULA, and Disclaimers. This is how it works: 

The plugin creates a simple page in your WordPress admin where it allows you to do the following:
- By providing your company name and address, the plugin will generate text for Privacy Policy, Terms of Use, Cookies Policy, EULA, and Disclaimers. 
- The company name and address you provided, will be autofilled into text for your new Privacy Policy, Terms of Use, Cookies Policy, EULA, and Disclaimers. 
- You can then generate pages for Privacy Policy, Terms of Use, Cookies Policy, EULA, and Disclaimers at once, or individually. 
- If you don\'t want to create a page through this plugin, text and html for these documents is provided, so you paste them where you like.

== Installation ==
Install and activate the Auto Privacy Docs plugin. A menu item for \"Auto Privacy Docs\" becomes available in the left admin menu. Provide your company name and address on this page, and click save changes. Text for your documents will be provided for you to review.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Does this plugin publish my pages immediately? =

No. The plugin generates text for the pages that you can review first. Adjustments to the text can be made first. And pages are not created until you click the button to do so.

= Where does the text for these documents come from? =

These are general use policies for these documents.
